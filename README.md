I'm a huge fan of virtual reality and its popularity has been skyrocketing lately. It's really interesting to see large corporations like Mozilla take on a full fledged development of something that is still very much brand new to the industry. The idea of being able to access the internet within a virtual reality setting is something so surreal yet commonplace. Very excited to see more internet browsers and software will be incorporated into VR devices.
